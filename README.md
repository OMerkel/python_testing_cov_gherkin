# Python Testing / Coverage Measurement / Gherkin Test Specs

The code sample uses Unit testing and coverage measurement.

It is used to show problematics like measure 100% coverage while no single useful unit test assertion was executed.
Another code example shows how 100% coverage is achieved with some unit test assertions in place.
The Positive Functional test ran but does this mean we provided and selected the unit tests well?
Finally additional test types get introduced covering that here Boundary Testing, Sanity Testing, Negative Functional Testing is done.
The we are using Gherkin for Test Specs in Python comments. This will enable Test or Code Reviewers to compare
implemented functional code with test code and the test specification.

Does it support and help in a software development process?

The solution shows a low effort approach to be used for software development, doesn't it?
